= the linux zen modifications
- the neurotic organization
+ our first release.  made by tim perkins <tperkins@neurotic.org>,
  released under the GPL.

* intro
   thank's for choosing to download then linux zen modifications.
   as of v.0.1b all the zen modifications do is provide a really
   neat color/prompt scheme mechanism, a script called 'motd'
   that just display's your message of the day, and a script called
   'vhosts' which will check a list ip's you specify and create
   a pretty table of the ip and what the dns lookup of the ip is.
   the zen mod's also include some aliasing features. v.0.1b only
   include's MS-DOS command's aliased to unix commands.  future
   release's might include IRC aliases and a few others.
   below, are some frequently asked questions.
   - what are these 'zen mods' programmed in?
      perl and bash.
   - why would i want to use them?
      they make your linux box a bit easier to use for dos users.
      they also make your box elite. ;)
   - how system intensive are they?
      not very. i'd say that if your computer is anything recent
      that you wouldn't even notice when someone runs the
      configuration utility.

* intructions
   there are two ways to install the zen mod's.  the first is to
   use the 'zeninstall' script that i have included.  the other
   way is to install them by hand.  i'll try to describe both
   ways.
   - way 1
      decompress zen-0.x.tar.gz (which i assume you've already
      done since your reading this).  run the zeninstall script
      that i have included.  modify the /etc/zen/ips/machine_ips
      file and put all of your ip's in it (or at least the ones
      that you want to show up on the 'vhosts' command). now you
      need to modify your global bashrc and profile. (i have
      included mine as examples).  usually these files are located
      in /etc/bashrc and /etc/profile (at least on redhat 5.x).
   - way 2
      just in case my 'zeninstall' script doesn't work, you can
      ungzip and 'tar xvf' the zen.tar.gz (that should be in the
      directory that this README is in.  then move then 'zen'
      folder to /etc.  modify the machine_ips (in /etc/zen/ips),
      modify your global bashrc and global bash profile. and voila
      your done.

* comments
   zen is far from being complete.  check back often for updates,
   since this is going to be an on going project.  if you want to 
   help PLEASE, PLEASE e-mail Tim <tperkins@neurotic.org> with
   idea's or what you can do to help.
